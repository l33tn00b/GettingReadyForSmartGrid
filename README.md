# Preface
Getting ready for Smart Grid Integration

This is to document how I'm grappling with Smart Grid Integration. 

# Equipment
I'd love to integrate

- Chinese Solar Generator with approx. 10 kWp,
- Chinese Battery having a capacity of 20 kWh,
- Austrian Wallbox capable of 22kW charging,
- German Electric Vehicle with approx. capacity of 40 kWh,
- Not-So-German Heat Pump (normally 2..4 kW, with additional electrical heating of 12kW).

All the stuff is networked and has various - incompatible, of course - APIs.

# Totally unfounded observations
- Our grid sucks. There's worse but there's also much better. Why? Some time ago EU regulations degraded grid capacity: In the 70s there were massive capacities for residential areas (nuclear power, everybody had electrical heating). Then, EU regulations downgraded the minimum standard (and no one wanted to pay for more than the (newly set) bare minimum). So we now have residential areas which are unfit for large electrical loads (think EV, heat pump,...). I'm happy to live in a house having 3x50 Amps breakers only to have these downgraded to 35 Amps). Finger to you! And a big finger to our officials unable to rectify this mess, instead trying to push electrification while at the same time talking about forced limiting of consumption. 
- Could someone please fix this mess of incompatible APIs and standards? EU? See above...

# What I've tried...

## evcc for automated vehicle charging when having surplus energy
Upsides:
- Works with the solar generator and battery (Modbus TCP local network API) .
- Works with the car (Manufacturer Web API)
- Initially worked with the wallbox (local network https API).

Long story short: It sucks. 
- First, they broke my wallbox integration by pushing an update that made sponsorship mandatory for my type of wallbox. 
- Then, there's that "my way or the highway" philosophy. There is no way of manually starting a charge (i.e. via the wallbox app or an RFID card). That's a no-go for my significant other...  Some ideas die fast.

So I threw that one out. Next idea for surplus charging is hacking a solution with my home automation server.

## Getting Pricing Data for variable electricity tariffs.
Dynamic electricity prices are a thing in Europe. Many European countries have implemented dynamic pricing schemes as part of their efforts to transition to a more sustainable and efficient energy system.

For example, in the UK, many energy suppliers offer time-of-use tariffs that vary the cost of electricity depending on the time of day. In France, the "Heures Creuses" (off-peak hours) system offers reduced electricity prices during certain hours of the day and night. Similarly, in Germany, some utilities offer "GrÃ¼nstromIndex" tariffs that adjust the cost of electricity based on the availability of renewable energy sources.

The European Union has also encouraged the implementation of dynamic pricing schemes as part of its efforts to promote energy efficiency and reduce greenhouse gas emissions. The EU's Energy Efficiency Directive requires member states to ensure that "final customers are provided with electricity tariffs that reflect the cost of supplying electricity at different times, where it is technically and economically feasible to do so."

While not yet prevalent, dynamic electricity prices are increasingly common in Europe as utilities and governments look for ways to promote a more efficient, sustainable, and consumer-friendly energy system.

There's two large consumers (car and heat pump). These loads can be shifted to off-peak times when electricity is much cheaper. That makes having a variable electricity tariff quite logical. Additionally, there's the battery which can be charged when electricity is cheap. but first, we need to get a feel for it. So we need data... Theres different tariffs but all are based on day ahead traded electricity. So we need to access that data. Multiple possible solutions to get data from
- Spot Market exchange (EPEX)
- directly from electricity company (Tibber / Awattar)
- EU Transparency Platform.

### EPEX Spot Market
- https://www.epexspot.com/en/market-data?market_area=DE-LU&trading_date=2023-03-14&delivery_date=2023-03-15&underlying_year=&modality=Auction&sub_modality=DayAhead&technology=&product=60&data_mode=table&period=&production_period=
- -Limited Data available (no history)
- -No (free) download
- -Requires web scraping
- +chart available

### Awattar
Haven't tried for current data yet because they stopped offering to new customers.
But one can download historical pricing data via their Web API.
Figuring out the final price is tricky because it doesn't get displayed (only Spot Market Price).

### Tibber
- -Limited Data available (next day doesn't work)
- +All inclusive pricing displayed
- +Better chart than EPEX
- -Web Scraping required to extract data (chart only, table can only be scraped by clicking through the chart -> selenium).

### ENTSO-E (EU Transparency Platform)
- +historical data available
- -chart sucks
- +download data via api 
- -need to apply for api token
- +api token is available for free (and pretty quickly)
- +different formats for download
- +data download without api is possible (https://transparency.entsoe.eu/transmission-domain/r2/dayAheadPrices/show?name=&defaultValue=false&viewType=TABLE&areaType=BZN&atch=false&dateTime.dateTime=27.03.2022+00:00|CET|DAY&biddingZone.values=CTY|10Y1001A1001A83F!BZN|10Y1001A1001A82H&resolution.values=PT60M&dateTime.timezone=CET_CEST&dateTime.timezone_input=CET+(UTC+1)+/+CEST+(UTC+2)#)
- +python client for api available (pandas based): https://github.com/EnergieID/entsoe-py

### Solutions
#### Data Display (Chart)
Outgrew this repo. See [over here](https://github.com/l33tn00b/tibberPriceChartScraper).

  
#### Actionable Data
Whoever is selling variable pricing tariffs usually buys electricity on the spot market (and adds some cents to it). So we need that data to determine the optimum times for charging the car and turning off the heat pump.
